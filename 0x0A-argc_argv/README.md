# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to _be_ able to explain to anyone, ==without the help of Google==:

    What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
    How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
